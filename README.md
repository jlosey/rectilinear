# rectilinear
rectilinear.py is a python script that perfoms a least squares fit to data for the law of rectilinear diameters.

T<super></super> = A<sub>1</sub>(&rho;<sub>L</sub> - &rho;<sub>L</sub>) + T<sub>C</sub>

(&rho;<sub>L</sub> + &rho;<sub>L</sub>)/2 = &rho;<sub>C</sub>; + A<sub>2</sub>(T<sub>C</sub> - T)

This was developed for finding the critical temperature and density of vapour-liquid equilibrium curves.
